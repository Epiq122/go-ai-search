# Course Overview: Learning AI Search Through Maze Solving

## What You'll Learn

This course teaches you **foundational AI concepts** through building a maze-solving program. By the end, you'll understand how search algorithms work and be able to apply these concepts to real-world programming problems.

## Course Structure

Each document in this course covers one focused topic:

- **Go Fundamentals** - Basic programming concepts you need to know
- **Data Structures** - How stacks and frontiers work in search problems
- **DFS Algorithm** - Complete implementation walkthrough
- **Real-World Applications** - How to use these concepts in actual projects
- **Next Steps** - Where to go from here

## What This Project Does

Think of this as building a **smart robot navigator**. Your program:

1. **Reads a maze** from a text file
2. **Finds the shortest path** from start (A) to goal (B)
3. **Shows you the solution** with step-by-step visualization
4. **Measures performance** to see how efficient your algorithm is

## Real-World Parallels

This same logic powers:

- **GPS Navigation** - Finding the best route to your destination
- **Game AI** - Characters navigating through virtual worlds
- **Web Crawlers** - Search engines exploring websites
- **Network Routing** - Internet data finding paths between servers

## Why This Matters for Your Career

### Programming Skills You'll Gain

- **Algorithm thinking** - Breaking complex problems into steps
- **Data structure usage** - Choosing the right tools for the job
- **Performance analysis** - Understanding why some solutions are faster
- **Go programming** - Clean, efficient code patterns

### Career Benefits

- **Interview preparation** - Most tech companies ask algorithm questions
- **Problem-solving mindset** - Approach challenges systematically
- **Code quality** - Write more efficient, maintainable programs
- **System design** - Think about scalability and performance

## Course Philosophy

### Clear and Practical

- **No jargon** without explanation
- **Real examples** you can relate to
- **Step-by-step** breakdowns
- **Practical applications** you can use immediately

### Learning by Building

Instead of just theory, you'll:

- **See actual code** that solves real problems
- **Understand each line** and why it's written that way
- **Connect concepts** to things you already know
- **Apply knowledge** to new scenarios

## Prerequisites

You should know:

- **Basic programming** in any language (variables, loops, functions)
- **Command line basics** (running programs, file navigation)
- **Willingness to learn** Go syntax (we'll explain as we go)

## How to Use This Course

### Reading Order

1. Start with **Go Fundamentals** if you're new to Go
2. Work through each document **in sequence**
3. **Try the examples** as you read them
4. **Run the actual code** to see it work

### Active Learning

- **Take notes** on concepts that click for you
- **Pause and experiment** with the code examples
- **Ask questions** about parts that seem unclear
- **Connect ideas** to your own programming experience

## What Success Looks Like

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

- **Explain how DFS works** to another programmer
- **Implement similar algorithms** in your own projects
- **Recognize search problems** in real-world scenarios
- **Choose appropriate data structures** for different tasks
- **Write cleaner, more organized Go code**

## Getting Started

Ready to begin? Head to **Go Fundamentals** to start learning the building blocks you'll need for this project.

Remember: **This is about understanding concepts, not memorizing code.** Take your time, experiment, and focus on the "why" behind each decision.
